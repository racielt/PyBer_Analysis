# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The main purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate and show how the service is different in each city type and how this information can be used by the decision-makers at PyBer and make some decisions based on this data.

In this analysis we present de relationship between city types, number of drivers and fares, how each category affected the other one.

At the end the decision-makers have the necessary information regarding the city type that will need more resources, more driver support, and which city type is generating more income. They will make improves to access ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved territories.


## Results:

-	If we compare the number of total rides per city type, we can see that the urban type has the biggest number, 13 times the number of the rural type, and more than double than suburban.

-	Regarding the number of drivers per city type, we can conclude that it is a dependent number of the number of rides, meaning that if a city type has more rides, we will have more drivers. The urban type is the one that had the greater number of drivers.

-	In the total fare, we can see that as we have a greater number of rides in urban type, the total fare amount is greater in this city type, and the rural has the lowest one.

-	But talking about the average fare per ride and per driver, we see that the rural type has the highest one,

-	We can assume that it must be related with the ride distances, if the ride is a longer one, the fare itâ€™s going to be higher.


## Summary:

Based on the results the recommendations are as follows:

-	Increase the number of drivers in rural city type, because the number of drivers that the company has in that type is not going to be sufficient for the rural demand. As we can see each driver takes two rides.

-	Move some drivers from the urban city type to the suburban and rural area, so you can improve the usage of your work team, the drivers.

-	Make a deeper analysis, where you consider the ride distances, so we can have more information that give us a big panorama of the relationship between the fare, the number of drivers, the distance, and the time of the ride.
